2. **Generated URL**: `/api/campaign/download/campaigns/10_1757983503972.zip` ✅ (Correct)

## 🛠️ Remediation Implementation

### **Problem Statement**
Users could successfully:
- ✅ Scrape Amway product data
- ✅ Generate AI campaigns with images
- ✅ Create and store ZIP files in R2
- ❌ **BLOCKED**: Download completed campaigns (404 error)

### **Code Changes Made**

#### **File**: `/app/api/campaign/download/[...key]/route.ts`

**Before** (Caused 404):
```typescript
// Line 15: Added unnecessary "campaigns/" prefix
const campaignKey = `campaigns/${params.key.join('/')}`;
// Result: campaigns/campaigns/10_1757983503972.zip ❌
```

**After** (Fixed):
```typescript
// Line 16: Use path segments directly
const campaignKey = params.key.join('/');
// Result: campaigns/10_1757983503972.zip ✅
```

### **Validation Results**

#### **Before Fix**:
```
📥 Step 3: Testing campaign download...
⚠️  Download test failed: 404
[wrangler:inf] GET /api/campaign/download/campaigns/9_1757982985254.zip 404 Not Found (14ms)
```

#### **After Fix**:
```
📥 Step 3: Testing campaign download...
✅ Download endpoint accessible
   Content-Length: 1111887 bytes
[wrangler:inf] GET /api/campaign/download/campaigns/10_1757983503972.zip 200 OK (7ms)

  it('should return 200 for valid campaign URLs', async () => {
    // Test valid download paths
  });

  it('should return 404 for expired campaigns', async () => {
    // Test expiration logic
  });

  it('should serve correct content-type headers', async () => {
    // Test file headers
  });
});
```

### **Load Testing** (Production)
```bash
# Test concurrent downloads
ab -n 100 -c 10 http://localhost:8788/api/campaign/download/campaigns/test.zip
