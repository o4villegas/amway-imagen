## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Product Image Display Analysis

#### Current State
All products in the system are using placeholder images (`/api/placeholder-image`) by design:
- **Nutrilite Women's Pack**: Shows placeholder (not broken)
- **Artistry Powder Foundation**: Shows placeholder (not broken)
- **eSpring Water Purifier**: Shows placeholder (not broken)

#### Technical Implementation
The application has a sophisticated image handling system:

1. **Image Proxy System** (`/app/api/image-proxy/[...path]/route.ts`):
   - Properly configured to handle Amway image URLs
   - Includes proper headers for scraping protection bypass
   - Graceful fallback to placeholders on error
   - Edge runtime optimized

2. **Product Browser Component** (`/components/campaign/ProductBrowser.tsx`):
   - Implements `getProxiedImageUrl()` function for URL transformation
   - Handles Amway-specific image URL patterns
   - Built-in error handling with `onError` fallback
   - Responsive image sizing with Next.js Image component

3. **Placeholder Image API** (`/api/placeholder-image`):
   - Professional SVG placeholder design
   - Consistent "Product Image Not Available" messaging
   - Proper visual hierarchy and branding

#### Issue Classification
**ISSUE ID: IMG-001**
**TITLE: Application Using Placeholder Images Instead of Real Product Photos**
**SEVERITY: Medium**
**CATEGORY: UX/UI**
**AFFECTED WORKFLOWS: Product selection, campaign preview**

Real Amway product photos should display for better user experience and campaign quality

**USER IMPACT:**
- Users cannot see actual products they're creating campaigns for
- Reduces confidence in product selection
- May impact campaign quality expectations
- Professional image generation requires real product reference

**REMEDIATION PLAN:**
- File to modify: `/app/api/products/seed/route.ts`
- Replace placeholder URLs with actual Amway product image URLs
- Test image proxy with real URLs to ensure proper functionality
- Consider implementing product scraping for real-time image acquisition

### 2. Product Search and Data Quality

#### Strengths
- **Comprehensive Product Data**: Complete product information including names, descriptions, categories, brands
- **Search Functionality**: Multi-parameter search (query, category, limit)
- **Database Structure**: Well-organized with proper relationships
- **Category Filtering**: Nutrition, Beauty, Home categories properly implemented

#### Product Catalog Analysis
